Thanks! Here's an updated version of the **README** with details about the two types of landmarks, including your custom ArUco tag generation:

## Mind Cloud Adaptation for GZ Sim Harmonic and ERC25 Remote Extension

This repository provides a customized and simplified Mars Yard environment adapted for use with **Gazebo Sim Harmonic** and **ROS 2 Jazzy**. It is based on the original model provided [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kvJ4vRcukgJdDpJXkft8xSptM3QwUmzl), which we cleaned and reduced from **over 3 million** faces to approximately **300,000** to improve performance.  
*(Note: We are not 3D modeling experts, but this is the best optimization we could achieve.)*

### Key Contributions

- ‚úÖ Created a usable version of the Mars Yard simulation model  
- ‚úÖ Added a **ZED X camera** to the rover model *(camera positions may not be accurate)*  
- ‚úÖ Included two types of **landmarks** based on the [ERC2025 Technical Handbook](https://github.com/husarion/erc2025/blob/main/TECHNICAL_HANDBOOK.md):
  - üß≠ **Type 1 ‚Äì ArUco Tags**:  
    Automatically generated using a custom script with textures from the `DICT_4X4_100` dictionary.
  - üîç **Type 2 ‚Äì Discovery Landmarks**:  
    Random 3D objects placed in the environment, intended to simulate exploration and unknown object detection.

### Installation & Setup

1. **First**, follow the instructions and install the base package from:  
   üëâ https://github.com/husarion/husarion_ugv_ros

2. **Then**, download the customized Mars Yard simulation files from:  
   üëâ https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/146GUOfDKCR5hZu9cTbaz5I9Dk50ku7-T?usp=drive_link

3. Move the downloaded folder to your `src` directory inside your ROS 2 workspace and merge it with the existing packages.

### How to Launch the Simulation

```bash
ros2 launch husarion_ugv_gazebo simulation.launch.py gz_world:=`ros2 pkg prefix husarion_gz_worlds`/share/husarion_gz_worlds/worlds/mars_yard.sdf
```
